"John Nathaniel Aucott, M.D.", M.D.,Male,Lyme Disease,"Dr. John Aucott and his colleague Dr. Soloski are engaged in a multi-year longitudinal study of patients diagnosed with early-untreated Lyme disease and matched controls, the Study of Lyme disease Immunology and Clinical Events (or SLICE). This has generated a large and unique repository of clinical data and biological samples from patients with a range of clinical outcomes and collected over several seasons.  We have recently published on the immune heterogeneity of patients with Lyme disease using samples from this collection. Our goal is to utilize these samples to help identify new biomarkers of Lyme disease that will inform as to disease diagnosis, disease outcome and understand disease pathophysiology.  Dr. Aucott’s clinical research site recruits and enrolls participants with untreated early Lyme disease and erythema migrans for these studies. Participants have extensive clinical characterization pre and post-treatment. The Lyme sample biorepository will provide serum samples from this collection for the proposed studies and the clinical study team will as aid in the analysis and interpretation of results.",-,-,MD; Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (1984)   Internal Medicine; Case Western Reserve University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center (1987)   Medicine; Case Western Reserve University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center (1990)   Infectious Diseases; Case Western Reserve University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center (1989)   Medicine; Case Western Reserve University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center (1991)   American Board of Internal Medicine (Infectious Disease) (2016)   American Board of Internal Medicine (Internal Medicine) (1988)

"Franco Rafael D'Alessio, M.D.", M.D.,Male,Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,"Our laboratory has focused in studying immunological mechanisms underlying resolution of lung inflammation and injury. We found a critical role for Regulatory T cells (Tregs) and pro-repair macrophages in controlling excessive innate immune responses in the lung to mediate resolution of lung injury. We found that resolution of lung inflammation is an active process, distinct from early injury, in which Tregs cellular interactions with alveolar macrophages, alveolar epithelium, and other lymphocytes orchestrate a series of events that ultimately lead to lung repair. While cell-based therapy using Tregs represents a therapeutic strategy for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), endogenous Treg control mechanisms to augment their pro-repair function represents a more feasible approach to enhance resolution and improve ARDS outcomes.",410-550-5864;410-464-6641;+1-410-502-7683;Phone: 410-550-4887 | Fax: 410-550-2612,"Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center5501 Hopkins Bayview Circle Asthma and Allergy Center Baltimore, MD 21224;The Johns Hopkins Hospital (Main Entrance)1800 Orleans St. Sheikh Zayed Tower Baltimore, MD 21287",MD; Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia (2000)   Internal Medicine; Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (2004)   Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine; Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (2008)   American Board of Internal Medicine (Critical Care Medicine) (2011)

One major focus is on Notch and other pathways which play a key role in both normal development and in neoplasia. They are currently analyzing the long terms effects of Notch blockade on cancer stem cells in brain and eye tumors, how therapeutic resistance emerges, and the basis of the sometimes antagonistic effects of various Notch receptors. They are also examining the role of c-Myc in the stem cell phenotype of cancer. Identifying novel genetic changes in ocular surface tumors and other poorly understood neoplasms represents another focus.",Phone: 410-955-9790,"The Johns Hopkins Hospital (Main Entrance)1800 Orleans St. Sheikh Zayed Tower Baltimore, MD 21287",MD PhD; University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas (1997)   Pathology; Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (2001)   American Board of Pathology (Anatomic Pathology) (2003)   American Board of Pathology (Neuropathology) (2003)

"Jill Ann Fahrner, M.D., Ph.D."," M.D., Ph.D.",Female,Medical Genetics,"Dr. Fahrner’s laboratory research uses novel mammalian cell systems and mouse models to elucidate disease mechanisms responsible for Mendelian disorders of the epigenetic machinery (MDEMs) and to identify therapies to treat these conditions. Specifically, her team focuses on Kabuki syndrome 1 and 2 (KS1 and KS2) and Weaver syndrome (WS). KS1 and KS2 are phenocopies of one another but result from mutations in distinct components of the epigenetic machinery, and disruption of both are expected to tip the balance of chromatin toward a more closed, transcriptionally silenced state at target genes. KS2 and WS are molecularly and phenotypically opposing disorders with the former exhibiting growth retardation and resulting from deficiency of the eraser of the H3K27 methylation (H3K27me) silencing mark, and the latter exhibiting overgrowth and resulting from deficiency of the writer of the same H3K27me mark. The Fahrner lab is using mouse models of these related disorders to elucidate mechanisms of abnormal growth. They recently elucidated a novel mechanism of growth retardation in KS1, which results from haploinsufficiency of KMT2D, encoding a histone methyltransferase writer of H3K4 methylation (H3K4me). The mechanism involves disrupted endochondral ossification and precocious chondrocyte differentiation within KS1 mouse growth plates due to reduced deposition of H3K4me3 at a novel target (Shox2). Elucidation of mechanisms of growth retardation in the phenotypically similar disorder KS2, which results from deficiency of the H3K27me eraser KDM6A, is also ongoing.",410-955-3071;410-464-6641;+1-410-502-7683;Phone: 410-955-3071 | Fax: 410-367-3231;Phone: 410-955-3071 | Fax: 410-367-3231,"The Johns Hopkins Hospital (Main Entrance)1800 Orleans St. Sheikh Zayed Tower Baltimore, MD 21287;The Johns Hopkins Hospital600 N.

Skin and cutaneous sensory nerves form the neuro-immuno-endocrine circuitry, the disruption of which may underlie the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy. Dr. Ho’s research focuses on the role of skin-derived molecules such as neurotrophic factors and inflammatory cytokines in the maintenance of the cutaneous sensory nerve fibers and in the development of neuropathic pain.

In collaboration with colleagues in the infectious disease department, she has led a multidisciplinary research team for three CDC-funded studies focused on neonatal healthcare-associated infections in low-resource settings. She is interested in the epidemiology of neonatal bloodstream infections and antimicrobial resistance, using the Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program (CUSP) to improve health care worker adherence to best practices in infection prevention, and assessing the role of maternal colonization in transmission of pathogens to neonates. Dr. Johnson has served as a technical expert to the CDC in a landscape analysis of neonatal infection prevention in low resource settings, work supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. To enhance her training in clinical research methodology, Dr. Johnson received her doctorate in April 2020 in clinical investigation through the Graduate Training Program in Clinical Investigation; a joint program of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

In collaboration with Johns Hopkins neuroscientists, his laboratory helped create stem cell lines from ALS patients using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) methodologies. These cells will allow for the development of human cell lines which can be used for both the basic understanding of ALS astrocyte and motor neuron biology, as well as eventually identifying ALS therapeutics. Researchers in the Maragakis lab also focus on the potential therapeutic role of astrocyte replacement in ALS using glial stem cells. By transplanting glial stem cells into ALS animal models, the researchers in the Maragakis lab found that the stem cells can engraft, migrate and differentiate into astrocytes, and subsequently provide neuroprotection to vulnerable motor neuron pools. The team uses stem cell transplantation biology to understand the influences of mutant SOD1 astrocytes on normal, healthy motor neurons. A significant laboratory effort is underway to translate these discoveries into therapies for patients with ALS.",410-614-9874;410-464-6641;+1-410-502-7683,"The Johns Hopkins Hospital (Main Entrance)1800 Orleans St. Sheikh Zayed Tower Baltimore, MD 21287;Johns Hopkins Outpatient Center (now called Levi Watkins, Jr., M.D., Outpatient Center)601 N.

"Frances Josephine Northington, M.D.", M.D.,Female,"Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine, Neonatology","Frances Northington’s research focuses on mechanisms of neurodegeneration following neonatal hypoxic-ischemia (HI) brain injury. Dr. Northington’s research team has developed one of the first mouse models of the role of hypothermia treatment following neonatal HI. Along with Dr. Chavez-Valdez, they have published multiple papers on this model. Dr. Northington was the first to recognize the importance of programmed necrosis in neonatal HI and has now defined novel roles for the endoplasmic reticulum and proteasome system in this injury. Dr. Northington has just begun a collaboration with Sujatha Kannan (Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine-Pediatrics) to investigate the potential of nanoparticle delivery of N-acetyl cysteine as a microglial targeted therapeutic to prevent the development of cerebral palsy. This dendrimer-drug combination is under review by the FDA for use in humans. Additionally she, along with her former fellow, Dr. Fang, have found important novel responses to treatments aimed at mitochondrial neuroprotection in the neonatal model. In collaboration with Jiangyang Zhang and Dan Wu, Dr. Northington is co-investigator on an NIH grant that investigates novel and advanced imaging analysis of neonatal brain injury. From this work has recently come the first direct evidence of nuclear and mitochondrial swelling detected by MRI/DTI. She also collaborates with Raul Chavez-Valdez in his interest in the role of HI in perturbation of brain neurotrophins following neonatal HI. Dr. Northington is pioneering work on the effect of early life injury in the setting of genetic susceptibility to Alzheimer’s disease with Lee Martin on a funded R21. With Lauren Jantzie, she is also introducing advanced metrics of cognition and executive function to the evaluation of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in newborns. Finally, Dr. Northington’s work extends to the clinic where Allen Everett, Ernest Graham and she have done a decadelong collection of neonatal brain injury biomarkers. She is funded through the NIH with several R01s, an R21 and a U01 grant.",410-955-5259;410-464-6641;+1-410-502-7683,"The Johns Hopkins Hospital (Main Entrance)1800 Orleans St. Sheikh Zayed Tower Baltimore, MD 21287",MD; University of Georgia (1985)   Pediatrics; University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (1988)   Neonatology; University of Virginia School of Medicine (1992)   American Board of Pediatrics (Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine) (1993)

He has been at the fore of discovering and demonstrating that inner and outer retinal layer pathology occur within the unmyelinated retina in MS (both quantitatively and qualitatively). He is committed to continuing to delineate and ascertain the mechanisms involved in the development of these findings, the clinical relevance of these changes (both locally in the retina, as well as more globally), and determine if this information may be used to guide the development of new, and potentially unique/novel effective MS therapies.

Dr. Tucker’s research focuses on tuberculous meningitis, the most severe form of extrapulmonary TB which disproportionately affects young children. The long-term goal of her research is to understand the pathogenesis of brain injury during meningitis in children and design antimicrobial and adjunctive therapy as well as therapeutic monitoring to improve treatment and prognosis of children with devastating infections. In pursuit of this goal, she developed the first pediatric rabbit model of tuberculous meningitis during her pediatric critical care medicine fellowship to understand how the infection affects the developing brain and to investigate how to optimize meningitis treatment. Dr. Tucker’s research benefits from a strong network of mentors and collaborators in neuroscience, pediatric infectious disease, nuclear medicine, pharmacology, and nanomedicine.

Her current research program and long-term career goals within clinical research include contributing to the existing body of knowledge about clinical pharmacologic aspects of the prevention and treatment of HIV and treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Her strong interest is in the development of novel drug delivery strategies that are broadly acceptable, less toxic to patients, implementable for programs and do not require daily pills, including nanoformulated, parenteral, long-acting antiretrovirals and microbicides. She is also interested in seeking treatment and prevention strategies that are behaviorally congruent and do not require patients to deviate significantly from existing behaviors. Dr. Weld is interested in such strategies primarily as a method to optimize adherence to treatment and preventive regimens, as adherence is the well-documented Achilles’ heel of any prevention or treatment intervention.",-,-,MD; Medicine; University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine (2006)   Medicine and Pediatrics; University of Maryland Medical Center (2010)   Infectious Diseases; Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (2016)   American Board of Internal Medicine (Infectious Disease) (2014)   American Board of Internal Medicine (Internal Medicine) (2011)
